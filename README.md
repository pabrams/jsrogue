# README

This is my roguelike based on the Coding Cookies "Building a Roguelike in Javascript" tutorial series.

It was originally forked from http://github.com/jokeofweek/jsrogue, and then I made a few changes.   

## Compile and Run

You must have node installed.

1. Clone the repository to local folder and open a command prompt
1. `npm install`
1. `tsc`
1. Double-click index.html and the game should open in your default browser.
